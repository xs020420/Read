[recursion]
The truth of recursion：Different thinking mode to solve a problem.You can never use recursion, but should understand it while it is used in current code.
Problem 1：How many hair a monkey has ？ One hair and the remain
Problem 2: How to sort a vector filled with nums ? Split it into two parts。And if aked how to sort the two parts, read the answer again.
Problem 3: How old are you? One Year older than the last.

See, a recursion is thinking reversed.
Sometimes, recursion is poor efficiency, for example,while being used to solve problem.Cause it need O(n) heap space.

While using recursive,do not try to jump into each brach cause we can not stack all the problem and analyize them.Just try to believe it can do it.
